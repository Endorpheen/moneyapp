## Installation

### For Development (Test) Build

#### Without Docker

1. **Install Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Python and Node.js installed on your machine.
   - Install Git if you havenâ€™t already.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open a command line or PowerShell and execute:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Endorpheen/MoneyApp.git
     cd MoneyApp
     ```

3. **Set Up the Backend:**
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Install the required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Apply database migrations:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```
   - Create a superuser for Django admin:
     ```bash
     python manage.py createsuperuser
     ```
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver  # The backend will run on http://localhost:8000
     ```

4. **Set Up the Frontend:**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     ```
   - Install the required packages:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the frontend server:
     ```bash
     npm start  # The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000
     ```

#### With Docker

1. **Install Docker:**
   - Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). Ensure you select the Docker image for Windows.

2. **Create a Directory for the Application:**
   - Create a separate folder on your computer where the project will reside (e.g., `MoneyApp`).

3. **Open PowerShell in the Desired Directory:**
   - Navigate to the `MoneyApp` folder in Windows Explorer, right-click in an empty space, and select "Open PowerShell here."

4. **Clone the Repository:**
   - In the opened PowerShell window, enter the following commands:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Endorpheen/MoneyApp.git
     cd MoneyApp
     ```

5. **Run the Application Using Docker:**
   - While in the project directory, execute:
     ```bash
     docker compose up --build
     ```
   - This command will create and start the necessary containers. The backend will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), and the frontend at [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002).

6. **Run Database Migrations:**
   - First, you need to find the `container_id` for your backend container. To do this, run the following command to list all running containers:
     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```
   - Look for the container running the backend service and copy its `CONTAINER ID`.

   - Once you have the `container_id`, run the migrations:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it <container_id> python manage.py migrate
     ```

7. **Create a Superuser:**
   - Similarly, create a superuser by running the following command (replacing `<container_id>` with your backend container's ID):
     ```bash
     docker exec -it <container_id> python manage.py createsuperuser
     ```
   - Follow the prompts in the terminal to enter the superuser credentials.

8. **Access the Application:**
   - You can now access the backend at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and the frontend at [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002).
   - Use the superuser credentials you just created to log in.

9. **Managing Categories and Users:**
   - To modify your budget categories, you need to do this through the backend.
   - The backend also allows you to add new users, edit transactions, and manage budgets.

10. **Stopping Containers:**
    - To stop the application, run:
      ```bash
      docker compose down
      ```

11. **Restarting After Stopping:**
    - To restart the application after stopping it, simply run:
      ```bash
      docker compose up
      ```
    - If you need to rebuild the containers considering changes, use:
      ```bash
      docker compose up --build
      ```

### Using Pre-built Docker Images

If you don't want to clone the repository or set up the project manually, you can use the pre-built Docker images hosted on Docker Hub. These images contain everything needed to run the application.

1. **Pull the backend image from Docker Hub:**
   ```bash
   docker pull end000/moneyapp-backend:latest
   ```

2. **Pull the frontend image from Docker Hub:**
   ```bash
   docker pull end000/moneyapp-frontend:latest
   ```

3. **Run the backend container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 end000/moneyapp-backend:latest
   ```

4. **Run the frontend container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 3002:3002 end000/moneyapp-frontend:latest
   ```

5. **Run Database Migrations (After Starting the Containers):**
   - First, find the `container_id` of the backend container by running:
     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```
   - Then, run the migrations using the following command:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it <container_id> python manage.py migrate
     ```

6. **Create a Superuser:**
   - Similarly, create a superuser by running the following command (replacing `<container_id>` with your backend container's ID):
     ```bash
     docker exec -it <container_id> python manage.py createsuperuser
     ```

Now your application should be fully functional with the backend available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and the frontend at [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002).
