     docker compose exec backend python manage.py createsuperuser
     ```
   - Follow the prompts in the terminal to enter the superuser credentials.

8. **Access the Application:**
   - You can now access the backend at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and the frontend at [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002).
   - Use the superuser credentials you just created to log in.

9. **Managing Categories and Users:**
   - To modify your budget categories, you need to do this through the backend.
   - The backend also allows you to add new users, edit transactions, and manage budgets.

10. **Stopping Containers:**
    - To stop the application, run:
      ```bash
      docker compose down
      ```

11. **Restarting After Stopping:**
    - To restart the application after stopping it, simply run:
      ```bash
      docker compose up
      ```
    - If you need to rebuild the containers considering changes, use:
