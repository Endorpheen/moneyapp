## Installation

### For Development Build

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MoneyApp.git
    cd MoneyApp
    ```

2. **Set up the backend**:
    ```bash
    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Apply migrations to set up the database
    python manage.py migrate

    # Create a superuser for accessing the Django admin panel
    python manage.py createsuperuser

    # Run the Django development server (backend will run on http://localhost:8000)
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

3. **Set up the frontend**:
    ```bash
    # Go to the frontend directory
    cd frontend

    # Install Node.js dependencies
    npm install

    # Start the React development server (frontend will run on http://localhost:3000)
    npm start
    ```

### For Production Build

To create and run the production build of the application on `http://localhost:41709`, follow these steps:

1. **Build the frontend for production**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run build
    ```

2. **Serve the production build**:
    ```bash
    # Serve the production build using serve
    serve -s build -l 41709
    ```

### Environment Variables
To manage sensitive information like API keys or database credentials, you need to create a `.env` file in the project root.

Example `.env` file for development:
```
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
```

#### How to Generate a Secret Key for Django

Django requires a secret key for cryptographic signing, and it must be kept safe. You can generate a new secret key using one of the following methods:

1. **Using Python**: Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'
   ```
   This will output a randomly generated secret key. Copy and paste it into your `.env` file as follows:
   ```plaintext
   SECRET_KEY=your-generated-secret-key
   ```

## Usage

1. **Register/Login**: Use the authentication forms to register a new user or log in with existing credentials.
2. **Dashboard**: View an overview of your income, expenses, and remaining budget.
3. **Transactions**: Add, edit, or delete financial transactions.
4. **Categories**: Manage categories to organize your transactions.
